                <p>This is the song of Monday, this is the song of Tuesday,</p>
                <p>This is the song of Wednesday, this is the song of Thursday,</p>
                <p>This is the song of Friday, this is the song of Saturday,</p>
                <p>This is the gun of Sunday,</p>
                <p>With a thousand bullets and ten thousand people,</p>
                <p>Let the bullets fly, through the high mountains, through the white clouds,</p>
                <p>Let them keep on flying, flying, flying, flying!!!</p>

                <br />

                <p>Please do not take what doesn't belong to you, on the surface it's just kindness.</p>
                <p>I deleted all my friends from my chat, leaving behind no pleasing thoughts.</p>
                <p>No one can mend the sadness I once felt, no one can understand my art.</p>
                <p>I've experienced cyberbullying, being baselessly accused by relatives of hitting their daughter.</p>
                <p>When I needed help, they all ignored me.</p>
                <p>I've been through all of this, and I've learned to grow.</p>
                <p>Learned how to be indifferent, learned how not to be kind.</p>
                <p>Happiness doesn't belong to me, so I'll just be a man seeking revenge.</p>

                <br />

                <p>No matter if anyone is still cursing at me on the internet,</p>
                <p>I don't care because it's just a group of kids venting their life's pressures.</p>
                <p>Mock me, and I fear I might not resist sending them to a mental hospital.</p>
                <p>Please, don't provoke me anymore. I'm not easy to mess with, I'm not the kind of man who won't fight
                    back.</p>
                <p>I'm strong, and I'll make you all disappear.</p>
                <p>Don't show up in front of me; I don't want to see brainless kids.</p>
                <p>Go home and learn some ethics before you come argue with me, child.</p>
                <p>Have you ever thought why so many people commit suicide?</p>
                <p>It's because of cyberbullying, kid.</p>
                <p>Please understand, please understand.</p>

                <br />

                <p>I'm strong because I've always been looked down upon by others.</p>
                <p>I'm strong because I've been cursed at before, and I don't want to be cursed at again.</p>
                <p>I'm strong because I don't want to beg anyone anymore; I want to rely on myself.</p>
                <p>I've always said I'm a king; I'm the king here.</p>
                <p>You all have to listen to me.</p>
                <p>The melody of this song is very pleasant, making you all kneel down.</p>
                <p>Call me "bro," and I'll buy you the limited edition bag you want.</p>
                <p>Their sales are all very high, almost unbelievable.</p>

                <br />

                <p>You know, I don't like listening to jazz, country, classical, or electronic music.</p>
                <p>I only listen to Hip-Hop.</p>
                <p>I use Hip-Hop to diss the people I don't like and express my dissatisfaction with others.</p>
                <p>Their pressures are too great; this song lacks a soul.</p>
                <p>It's just pure venting, and I'm venting too.</p>
                <p>I have a lot of stress, and I have to argue with those kids on the internet.</p>
                <p>I've had enough of all this; I've used foul language many times.</p>
                <p>I don't want to endure anymore; I want to destroy this world.</p>
                <p>They're all not qualified; please go home and be with your mothers.</p>

                <br />

                <p>Holding the gun tightly, tears streamed down,</p>
                <p>I'm not kind; I'm just pretending to be very forgiving.</p>
                <p>Pressure, sadness, disappointment, suicide, anger, injustice,</p>
                <p>Gripping the sword tightly, with a mouth that can't smile.</p>
                <p>Blood dripped onto the ground, it's the detested blood.</p>
                <p>Loss, helplessness, incapability, inability, mockery,</p>
                <p>I hate you all.</p>

                <br />

                <p>You're not human; you're monsters.</p>
                <p>I have no emotions; I'm a mute.</p>
                <p>I use Hip-Hop to diss you all.</p>
                <p>Why is everything so crazy?</p>
                <p>No one gives me feedback; I continue my resistance.</p>
                <p>You want to eat, and I want to feed you feces.</p>
                <p>I've heard countless songs, treating my mental illness.</p>
                <p>I don't want to argue anymore.</p>
                <p>But there's no way; the album theme of this song is describing the darkness of human nature.</p>
                <p>I don't want to argue anymore. I don't want to argue anymore.</p>
