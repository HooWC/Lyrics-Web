                <p>The wind keeps blowing, toppling the tower of my world</p>
                <p>Knowing well that this world has no end</p>
                <p>How should I protect</p>
                <p>All the people I love and those who love me</p>
                <p>All the people I think of and those who think of me, ooh—</p>
                <br />
                <p>Walking slowly forward with the shadow of the clouds</p>
                <p>The people who are not eliminated are striving to live</p>
                <p>There are still some things I haven't had the chance to say</p>
                <p>I hide all that pain in my heart</p>
                <br />
                <p>Time slowly disappears into the past</p>
                <p>We lift our feet</p>
                <p>And move forward, hidden in the shadow of the clouds</p>
                <p>Singing along with the sound of the wind</p>
                <p>Walking together to the end of the road</p>
                <br />
                <p>The wind keeps blowing, toppling the tower of my world</p>
                <p>Knowing well that this world has no end</p>
                <p>How should I protect</p>
                <p>All the people I love and those who love me</p>
                <p>All the people I think of and those who think of me</p>
                <br />
                <p>The wind keeps blowing, scattering my deepest pain</p>
                <p>I keep walking until that day finally arrives</p>
                <p>Hope arrives, freedom arrives, ooh—</p>
                <br />
                <p>Walking slowly forward with the shadow of the clouds</p>

                <p>There are still some things I haven't had the chance to say</p>
                <p>I hide all that pain in my heart</p>
                <br />
                <p>What plots have not appeared in the story yet</p>
                <p>We are still striving to explore this world</p>
                <p>And move forward, hidden in the shadow of the clouds</p>
                <p>Singing along with the sound of the wind</p>
                <p>Walking together to the end of the road</p>

                <p>Hope arrives, freedom arrives</p>
                <br />
                <p>I am still lost on that road</p>
                <p>I also know the pain in my heart is eternal</p>
                <p>I can never erase the pain that has troubled me for years</p>
                <p>I can only walk slowly forward with the wind</p>
                <p>Until, until the end</p>
                <p>Until, until destruction</p>
                <br />
                <p>The wind keeps blowing, toppling the tower of my world</p>
                <p>Knowing well that this world has no end</p>
                <p>How should I protect</p>
                <p>All the people I love and those who love me</p>
                <p>All the people I think of and those who think of me</p>

                <p>The wind keeps blowing, scattering my deepest pain</p>
                <p>I keep walking until that day finally arrives</p>
