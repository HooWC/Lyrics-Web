            <div id="lyrics-content">
                <p>Wearing a black hat, dressed in understated clothing, slowly walking out the door.</p>

                <p>Holding a baseball bat in my hand, seeing who dares to provoke me.</p>

                <p>How petty can you be? Crazy thoughts suddenly arise.</p>

                <p>Watch as I shut your foul mouths, leaving you speechless.</p>

                <p>My anger still lingers, my heart is dark, it's all because of you!</p>
                <br />
                <p>Oh, when I was a child, I was indeed easily bullied, But now that I've grown up,</p>

                <p>I remember those relatives who bullied me, and the disdainful looks from people in society.</p>

                <p>I will draw your blood, and the ground will be covered in your flesh.</p>

                <p>I am so brutal, I am like a demon.</p>

                <p>People don't need to pretend to be kind; they need to learn how to remain indifferent to everyone.
                </p>

                <p>I'm just imitating how you treated me; I won't be merciful.</p>

                <p>Just as you kept hurting me, I will return all those hurts to you.</p>
                <br />
                <p>They call me Satan and I'm willing to accept it because I also feel myself becoming more and more
                    brutal.</p>

                <p>Killing others indiscriminately, they're all targets of my practice, losing their smiles, losing all
                    of them.</p>

                <p>I don't pity them. They deserve it.</p>

                <p>Look at the depth of my anger. My arrows are so accurate, I'll beat you all.</p>

                <p>Your faces are covered in feces, and you look like ugly monsters.</p>

                <p>This time it's my turn to laugh at you, you're in no position to resist, you'll just keep on
                    struggling like mice
                    hahahaha.</p>

                <p>I'm a demon, a demon who specializes in killing you, I have many weapons to attack you.</p>

                <p>Don't underestimate me anymore, you don't have much chance to underestimate me.</p>
                <br />
                <p>When you guys used to bully me, why didn't you think of being kind?</p>

                <p>You guys used to be evil, now I'm the evil one, peeling your skin off!</p>

                <p>The blood on the ground, that's my hatred, you can't resist, you can't resist!</p>

                <p>Violence is always needed. Only violence can solve problems.</p>

                <p>There is no God at this time. Only hell awaits you.</p>

                <p>Pray without ceasing, trash. No matter how you pray, the god of this world is me.</p>

                <p>I'm punishing sinners. I'm not wrong. I'm always right.</p>
                <br />
                <p>They have nothing but lust in their eyes. The disgusting creatures keep screaming.</p>

                <p>Let me kill you all in one snatch so you can go to Elysium.</p>

                <p>This world is full of data, just like ants, just like people.</p>

                <p>They can't be killed.</p>

                <p>All they see is lazy, disgusting creatures who keep on sleeping.</p>

                <p>Let me kill you all with a sword and let you go to Elysium.</p>

                <p>There's so much sadness in this world, like unforgivable sins.</p>

                <p>I can't kill them all I can't kill them all.</p>
                <br />
                <p>They take my breath away. The air is so polluted.</p>

                <p>How many people can be killed with one mouth Blue turns to gray.</p>

                <p>The world is full of vengeance, take your inferiority complex and leave this world.</p>

                <p>I'm the only king in the darkness, I laugh at your incompetence, your brainlessness.</p>

                <p>I'll kill all your love.</p>

                <p>I'll kill you all! I'll kill you all! I'll kill you all!</p>

                <p>I can't kill them all I can't kill them all.</p>
