                <p>Night falls</p>
                <p>The monsters in the story come out and rampage, killing people</p>
                <p>They don't care what the issue is</p>
                <p>They just think it's a bad joke</p>
                <p>When the night turns blood-red</p>
                <p>All the tears slowly flow out</p>
                <p>When the hymn rings out, the world returns to its original state</p>
                <p>The believers also begin to learn to resist</p>
                <p>They don't eat meat, they only eat human flesh</p>
                <p>Darkness still exists in this world</p>
                <p>Night comes</p>
                <p>No one can escape</p>
                <p>Just like sacrificial lambs quietly awaiting death</p>
                <p>They continue to mock and harm everyone who loves them</p>
                <p>Wounds slowly open, blood flows everywhere</p>
                <p>Representing that humanity still exists in this world</p>
                <p>Don't think they are pitiful</p>
                <p>It's just that our positions are different</p>
                <p>Amen</p>
                <p>Tears fall, flesh falls</p>
                <p>Unseen, unheard</p>
                <p>But we have always believed it exists</p>
                <p>We believe, we believe</p>
                <p>This is a song talking about whether God exists or not</p>
                <p>Let's guess the truth</p>
                <p>When time is up, there's no escape</p>
                <p>They still foolishly wait for God's forgiveness</p>
                <p>No forgiveness, I see only emptiness</p>
                <p>One by one, lives are taken away</p>
                <p>Only a skeleton left, forgotten by people</p>
                <p>Who are they?</p>
                <p>Monsters from a world not belonging to this one</p>
                <p>They are not the god in your mind</p>
                <p>Perhaps you don't understand what this story is about</p>
                <p>But people have begun to lose patience</p>
                <p>They are ghosts and demons</p>
                <p>Next, they will suffer the torment of sin</p>
                <p>No escape, because they don't want to</p>
                <p>The faithful lose their ground</p>
                <p>They also become ordinary people, just like they describe</p>
                <p>Neither alive nor dead</p>
                <p>Everything is fake</p>
                <p>Why don't you understand?</p>
                <p>Amen</p>
                <p>Tears fall, flesh falls</p>
                <p>Unseen, unheard</p>
                <p>But we have always believed it exists</p>
                <p>We believe, we believe</p>
                <p>This is a song talking about whether God exists or not</p>
                <p>Let's guess the truth</p>
