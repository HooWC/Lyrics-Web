                <p>This is the battlefield, this is war</p>
                <p>No need for pity, no need for sympathy</p>
                <p>This is the battlefield, this is war</p>
                <p>Pick up your weapons, keep on fighting</p>
                <p>Don't think it's all in jest, what's lost can't come back</p>
                <p>The cruel world made me realize, to survive you must grow stronger</p>
                <p>A somber atmosphere surrounds everyone, as they've lost their own hands</p>
                <p>Blood flows, eyes turn to stone</p>
                <p>The love for the nation is so small</p>
                <p>I miss my family, I want to stay alive</p>
                <p>Even in the face of a storm, I won't fall</p>
                <br>
                <p>This is the battlefield, this is war</p>
                <p>To stay alive, you must grow stronger</p>
                <p>This is the battlefield, this is war</p>
                <p>To get back home, fight to stay alive</p>
                <br>
                <p>Love from no one, love that's fake</p>
                <p>Days of nostalgia, family to miss</p>
                <p>Weapons in hand, bodies at my feet</p>
                <p>Blood on the ground, the enemy's down 60%</p>
                <p>I keep moving, scan the QR code, pick up the enemy's weapon, keep fighting</p>
                <p>Don't be afraid, don't be scared</p>
                <p>This is your only chance</p>
                <p>The opportunity that can make you big money</p>
                <p>Alright, alright</p>
                <p>Next, I'm going to go all out</p>
                <p>I'm going to start dissing others</p>
                <br>
                <p>Yo, can't control your mouth, your face deserves a slap</p>
                <p>You're the worst here, I look down on you</p>
                <p>You only know how to curse others online every time, you've got no guts</p>
                <p>If you want to argue or fight, come out and meet me in person first</p>
                <p>Please don't waste so much time dissing others</p>
                <p>I can't be bothered with you little kids, even your parents don't like you</p>
                <p>You'd be better off studying and improving your morals</p>
                <p>Respect your teachers? Only if the teacher actually teaches; otherwise, I won't bother calling them a
                    teacher</p>
                <p>Others bullied me, I told the teacher, but the teacher asked me to apologize</p>
                <p>What kind of logic is that? Why should I apologize?</p>
                <p>He's not even qualified to be a teacher.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Next, let me explain why I don't like humans.</p>
                <p>When I pushed my sick mother to the hospital, it was my first time in a hospital.</p>
                <p>I didn't know where to go, and my mother looked like she was about to die.</p>
                <p>I asked passersby, but they all ignored me.</p>
                <p>Is it because I was still in my school uniform, and my mother didn't look well,</p>
                <p>so they thought we were troublesome trash?</p>
                <p>I dislike them, when I needed help,</p>
                <p>they didn't even want to acknowledge me.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Next, let me talk about my childhood.</p>
                <p>When I was 12 years old, celebrating Teachers' Day in elementary school,</p>
                <p>damn it, a relative of mine ran over and scolded me, saying I slapped her daughter.</p>
                <p>I wouldn't even dare touch a woman, and they're accusing me of hitting a female?</p>
                <p>It's absolutely unreasonable, no evidence, and she's cursing me like that in front of my friends.</p>
                <p>Who does she think she is? Does she even realize she left a scar on me, trash!</p>
                <p>Now, her daughter really owes me a slap.</p>
                <p>I don't want to be accused for no reason.</p>
                <p>I'm not a good person, and they aren't good people either.</p>
                <p>Fair!!!</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've seen too many hypocritical people and been hurt by them too.</p>
                <p>I've cried and cried, and I've started to become dark.</p>
                <p>I don't trust them, I don't need them.</p>
                <p>I respect myself, I want to kill them.</p>
                <p>They are not me, they don't understand.</p>
                <p>I don't want to diss them anymore.</p>
                <p>I don't want to diss them anymore.</p>
                <p>I don't want to diss them anymore.</p>
                <p>I don't want to diss them anymore.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But I just can't control myself!!!</p>
                <p>Screw all of you!</p>
                <p>My curse words can obliterate all of you.</p>
                <p>This isn't dissing, it's hatred.</p>
                <p>I hope you can understand where you've gone wrong.</p>
