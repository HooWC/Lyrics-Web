            <div id="lyrics-content">
                <p>I'm feeling exhausted, don't want to deal with anything else, I just want to be alone.</p>
                <p>The pressure's mounting, and I can't take it anymore, My mind's constantly thinking about how to get
                    through these
                    tough days.</p>
                <p>Every day is a struggle, I can't relax, I have so much to do, no time to play.</p>
                <p>Money's run out, I need to hustle, Whether it's through legal means or not, I'll do what it takes.
                </p>
                <p>I've always envied others, why am I so unlucky?</p>
                <p>If you're not mute, please speak up, Don't become that person I despise.</p>
                <p>My wallet was stolen, what more can you ask of me? I'm just a young person, but I understand all the
                    lessons.</p>
                <p>It feels like a knife has slashed through me, That sensation is so painful.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Hey, what is cyberbullying? It's the act of cursing others online,</p>
                <p>They never think about how others feel, it's always about themselves.</p>
                <p>Their hearts are like demons, living only for money, Their eyes all gleam with gold.</p>
                <p>They can kill others for money, and their relentless verbal violence, keeps attacking him</p>
                <p>And that "him" is me. Their hands are like machine guns, never stopping,</p>
                <p>Whether it's cursing or wishing me dead, they think they're righteous, it's laughable!</p>
                <p>Would justice wish death upon others? They're just brainless kids.</p>
                <p>One day, I'll send these people to a mental hospital, And make them regret the words they once said.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>No one cares about me, I'm always alone, please don't bother with me.</p>
                <p>The feeling of loneliness, the feeling of sadness, it's all...</p>
                <p>Please don't hurt me anymore, I just want a peaceful day.</p>
                <p>I've turned off all my computers and phones, not looking at any of the hateful comments online.</p>
                <p>I'm scared, I might not be able to take it and consider suicide.</p>
                <p>Life is so fragile, please stop your current actions.</p>
                <p>Cyberbullying is terrifying, please don't attack anymore.</p>
                <p>These hurts are unforgettable, please don't do this, don't do this anymore...</p>
                <br />
                <p>I don't want to keep living like this; what's the point of a life without love?</p>
                <p>Turning the page, it's the same answer again: no one will look at you, and this world is gray.</p>
                <p>I should have left this city long ago to find the home I want, no need to pretend to be a good person
                    anymore.</p>
                <p>Pressure, sadness, pressure, sadness, pressure, sadness.</p>
                <p>I apologize for my social behavior; none of you are what I desire.</p>
                <p>You hung up my call, the computer screen dimmed, and it feels like I'm back in my lonely times.</p>
                <p>Is where you are now any good? The words I can't say are forever hidden in my heart,</p>
                <p>But you always say to me, "Forget it."</p>
                <br />
                <p>Some say: Life is meant to be lived for yourself, don't concern yourself with those who hurt you.</p>
                <p>They aren't qualified to criticize you; you are unique; you must believe in yourself.</p>
                <p>You are the strongest; you are loved by someone; there's no right or wrong, be brave and act.</p>
                <p>Don't always doubt yourself, don't fear the future, don't fear losing.</p>
                <p>Don't hang your head low; be confident, young one.</p>
                <p>Don't forget your purpose, instead of being hurt by cyberbullying and losing your life.</p>
                <p>Everything is fleeting; cherish it; don't waste your time on those people.</p>
