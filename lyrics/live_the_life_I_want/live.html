                <p>This world is too dark, and people are very indifferent.</p>
                <p>I don't need their pity because I've already learned how to live.</p>
                <p>I don't need to rely on others; I've learned how to support myself.</p>
                <p>In those dark times, I saw many facets of human nature.</p>
                <p>I don't regret my choices now; I hope you can understand how cruel this world has become.</p>
                <p>Learn to depend on yourself; there's no need to ask others.</p>
                <p>Imitate them and learn how to be indifferent to everyone; that's what's fair.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Please don't talk nonsense.</p>
                <p>Time is running out, and they keep changing.</p>
                <p>Invisible people, unseen, always mocking us.</p>
                <p>There are no perfect people; only imperfect people can survive.</p>
                <p>They want me to fall, always mocking me.</p>
                <p>They look down on me, but I always act like I don't care.</p>
                <p>I just want to live the life I want.</p>
                <p>I don't want to waste time on them.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The flame in my heart has been burning, the tough days slowly passed.</p>
                <p>The sky turned from blue to gray, that feeling was very calm and painful.</p>
                <p>The flame in my heart has been burning, like you're being chased for debt.</p>
                <p>Never give up, for money, I can do anything.</p>
                <p>I'm not afraid, because I was born to control these foolish people.</p>
                <p>I just want to live the life I want.</p>
                <p>I just want to live the life I want.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I don't want to be a hacker; I handed them a black card directly.</p>
                <p>When I'm dressed in a black hat and black pants, it's their death sentence.</p>
                <p>I can't pity anyone, just like no one helped me back then.</p>
                <p>Learn to be indifferent, towards everyone.</p>
                <p>Preserve that indifference; that's where life's happiness lies.</p>
                <p>It's too troublesome; I don't even want to sing.</p>
                <p>Your performance is like garbage, always wasting my time.</p>
                <p>I've started walking towards the darkness, learned how to be corrupt.</p>
                <p>Now it's their turn to envy me, and I don't need to beg anyone anymore.</p>
                <p>No need to bow my head and sigh, because I've learned to grow.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The flame in my heart has been burning, the tough days slowly passed.</p>
                <p>The sky turned from blue to gray, that feeling was very calm and painful.</p>
                <p>The flame in my heart has been burning, like you're being chased for debt.</p>
                <p>Never give up, for money, I can do anything.</p>
                <p>I'm not afraid, because I was born to control these foolish people.</p>
                <p>I just want to live the life I want.</p>
                <p>I just want to live the life I want.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The flame in my heart has been burning, the tough days slowly passed.</p>
                <p>The sky turned from blue to gray, that feeling was very calm and painful.</p>
                <p>I just want to live the life I want.</p>
                <p>I just want to live the life I want.</p>
