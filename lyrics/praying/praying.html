                <p>The past that has passed away, like smoke, is shattering,</p>
                <p>The unseen future makes one lose direction,</p>
                <p>The unheard songs gradually turn into memories.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Who would still care about insignificant and meaningless me?</p>
                <p>In the darkness, the most terrifying thing is not being alone,</p>
                <p>But being forgotten by people in the passage of time.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I await the appearance of a ray of light to save me,</p>
                <p>I pray for happiness from the divine.</p>
                <br />
                <p>But all of this is just helpless self-consolation,</p>
                <p>Growing old, reaching the final destination, and having nothing.</p>
                <br />
                <p>The past that has passed away, like smoke, is shattering,</p>
