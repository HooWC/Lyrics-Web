                <p>I went from someone who never refused others to become someone who only knows how to say no.</p>
                <p>All hope has vanished; they just want me to kneel down and beg them.</p>
                <p>Confidence, pride, reputation,</p>
                <p>All gone, leaving only disappointment in people.</p>
                <p>Distrustful hatred, distrustful love,</p>
                <p>All the blame falls on me; I'm not a gentleman.</p>
                <p>But I am a good person; they forced me to become a devil.</p>
                <p>Becoming someone different, there's no turning back now.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Time is running out, I just want to get off work quickly.</p>
                <p>Please don't bother me anymore; I have too much work.</p>
                <p>Your attitude is bad; I don't want to help others anymore.</p>
                <p>Because I feel very disappointed, I never learn how to love someone.</p>
                <p>This is the laughter from the adults, and I have already gotten used to it.</p>
                <p>The hidden suffering is always behind the smile; if you don't like to smile, then don't.</p>
                <p>But I can't control myself; this emotion is very special.</p>
                <p>My name is a useless man, who cares which department he comes from.</p>
                <br />
                <p>No one cares, and no one wants to marry me.</p>
                <p>Alone till old age, working hard all along, but lacking a woman's love.</p>
                <p>They took away my luck, leaving only courage.</p>
                <p>I'm too lazy to compete with them; I'm just wasting my time.</p>
                <p>I like to read, especially horror novels.</p>
                <p>Kids fantasize about killing everyone with a gun.</p>
                <p>Such bloody stories can comfort me.</p>
                <p>I don't need the comfort of others; I can comfort myself.</p>
                <p>I have the ability to live, and I don't want to waste time.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Wasted all the efforts of yesterday, just want to see your smile.</p>
                <p>Please don't pity me, don't consider being with me.</p>
                <p>The hot blood in my heart hasn't changed; it's still the heart that loves you.</p>
                <p>This flavor belongs to you; I don't care about anyone else.</p>
                <p>Whether you have children or not, whether you're happy or not,</p>
                <p>It's all none of my concern now; tears fall.</p>
                <p>At this moment, I'm still alone; I've completed my mission.</p>
                <p>I won't wipe your tears anymore; it's not my task.</p>
                <p>I don't want to care anymore, and please don't lie to me again.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I enjoy writing songs for someone, putting all the words I want to say into the lyrics.</p>
                <p>I don't care if it sounds good or not, I'll give you what you want.</p>
                <p>My level is too low, I can't play with you.</p>
                <p>Enough time, I need to return to the future.</p>
                <p>Don't bother reading my boring lyrics; no one's singing them anyway.</p>
                <p>Taking care of everything, but neglecting myself.</p>
                <p>Laughing, crying,</p>
                <p>It's still the same, leaving me with shadows.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I gave you all my love, yet you want me to stay away from you.</p>
                <p>The helpless pain, even after fifty years, can't be healed.</p>
                <p>My mind is filled with you, your presence, your smile.</p>
                <p>Uncontrollable emotions, how do I solve them?</p>
                <p>The ending of the story is always so sad, and I've grown used to it.</p>
                <p>Crying alone at night, this feeling is very familiar.</p>
