            <div id="lyrics-content">
                <p>Dirty clothes, hands covered in mud, clutching a red apple tightly</p>
                <p>Gray rainy day, clothes soaked and mixed with tears</p>
                <p>Not sure whose fault it is, but never giving up, striving to survive</p>
                <p>In those dark days, the touch and dirty words of dirty humanity</p>
                <p>Envious glances, disdainful looks, eyes lacking confidence</p>
                <p>Life was never easy, why can't we get along</p>
                <p>That little girl cursed the heavens with eyes full of hatred</p>
                <p>Why can't we treat everyone fairly, why has this world lost its freedom</p>

                <br>

                <p>The little girl, mocked by others, tightly clutched a red apple</p>
                <p>With a face full of disappointment, she left that place</p>
                <p>Who would want to become the next her, with so little power</p>
                <p>Only able to act according to the words of those people, living in bitterness</p>
                <p>If there is a God in this world, why is there a lack of love</p>
                <p>If there is a devil in this world, that little girl would surely eliminate them all</p>
                <p>She doesn't need their blessings; that little girl can continue to grow</p>
                <p>She likes to gaze at the blue sea, but here, the sea is black</p>

                <br>

                <p>Special people don't have special love, even her biological parents don't want her</p>
                <p>All the efforts she put in turned to ashes, and she couldn't help but curse the heavens</p>
                <p>Please let me out quickly; it's too dark here, and I can't see or touch anything</p>
                <p>And please don't try to persuade me anymore; it's not rebellion, it's learning to mature</p>
                <p>The situation here is not good; run fast, take the one you love with you</p>
                <p>Running hard on the soil, a bunch of people chasing after her</p>
                <p>Damn world, in the end, she can't escape, the pain of punishment can't be sung</p>
                <p>The tears shed have already solidified, and the taste is not bad</p>

                <br />

                <p>You want her to continue crying, without anyone's help, how dark it is</p>
                <p>She cries, she cries, crying non-stop</p>
                <p>Here, there are only wretched people, no good people, so don't pity me</p>
                <p>I've already gotten used to being beaten like this, whether they're drunk or not</p>
                <p>A room full of foul odors, without a trace of tenderness</p>
                <p>A story without emotions, just a sad tale</p>
                <p>There's nothing more to say, and I don't want to waste too many words</p>
                <p>She has always yearned for the bustling city, for safe days</p>

                <br />

                <p>She can try, but she just can't run out of that dark place</p>
                <p>The corruption of human nature has made her vomit many times</p>
                <p>She didn't want to see it, but it was all too easy to witness those unpleasant scenes</p>
                <p>A slightly bloody red apple rolled to her feet</p>
                <p>She took a bite and found the taste delicious</p>
                <p>Perhaps she too is slowly turning into a demon</p>
                <p>Learning how to play a hypocritical role, no need for thanks, just revenge</p>
                <p>Everything is already too late, everything is already too late</p>
