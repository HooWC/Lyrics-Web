                <p>I don't want to be noticed, I don't want to be looked down upon</p>
                <p>The beauty of life is in my daily routine, looking at that beautiful sky</p>
                <p>I like purple because it represents poison, destroying everything I don't like</p>
                <p>I like blue because it represents the forest, proof of life</p>
                <p>I like black because my inner self is dark, and people are also dark</p>
                <p>The money I earn is not for reckless spending, I can divine who's right and who's wrong</p>
                <p>Making them feel that I'm amazing, just like the dazzling colors.</p>
                <br />
                <p>So many people are always living unhappily, and life's pressures are always so heavy</p>
                <p>Young one, see the future of business, earn a bit more money</p>
                <p>Young one, do you see those rich people? That's what your future looks like</p>
                <p>Young one, work hard in your studies and strengthen your expertise</p>
                <p>The girl who lives on the fifth floor will like you, hey</p>
                <p>All of this is not a problem, as long as you live and study hard</p>
                <p>You will shine just like colors.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I've mastered the art of flirting, I paid the bill, I'm climbing a mountain</p>
                <p>Don't disturb me, please stay away, I'm busy right now</p>
                <p>I haven't slept tonight, prepared some chicken legs, ready to devour</p>
                <p>Young one, is the moment of becoming an adult special?</p>
                <p>Young one, this is how reality is, don't doubt your good friends' words</p>
                <p>Do you still keep the flowers she gave you? Do you remember the kisses she gave you?</p>
                <p>This song is handwritten by me, written by me, sung by me, it doesn't belong to you, so don't take it
                </p>
                <p>They are all still just kids, I'm not interested.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I won an award, I stand on the stage, looking at everyone in the audience</p>
                <p>They all belong to me, I have many villas, the colors are very special, yeah</p>
                <p>Pink, brown, silver, gold</p>
                <p>Switching to another scene, I've seen many young people lose their dreams</p>
                <p>Working as someone else's employee to survive, this week I hope you can change</p>
                <p>I understand the dark days, because I've had dark days too</p>
                <p>I even wrote a whole album about the darkness of human nature</p>
                <p>Don't be like me, the fire left scars on me.</p>
                <br />
                <p>My dreams, I keep pursuing them without stopping, until they come true</p>
                <p>Some people mock, some people praise</p>
                <p>But I live for myself, don't care about others, my singing is my strength,</p>
                <p>In music, I found myself,</p>
                <p>Freedom is what I want, just like the story of a king and a thief</p>
                <p>Raise your hands, dance to my rhythm</p>
                <p>I can make you happy, fly freely in the sky.</p>
                <br />
                <p>When I opened my eyes, the sun had already set</p>
                <p>People keep cursing me on the internet, I dare not open the web</p>
                <p>They're all embodiments of demons, constantly attacking, they attack my heart</p>
                <p>Leaving behind many shadows, they too are embodiments of depravity</p>
                <p>I couldn't control my own body, always realizing my mistakes too late</p>
                <p>But it's all too late now, can't retrieve the pieces, can't turn back into yourself</p>
                <p>This world still has many colors.</p>
