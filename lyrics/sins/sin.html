                <p>We've separated, let go of everything</p>
                <p>Numb, lost everything</p>
                <p>They say we were destined to be together, what a laughable lie</p>
                <p>When I put on the black mask, no one can recognize me</p>
                <p>He's not the little sheep in their hearts; I have my own dreams</p>
                <p>Please don't talk about dreams anymore; this is reality, full of cruel humanity</p>
                <p>I've worked hard for 30 years; I've had enough of it all. I don't want to keep striving for you
                    anymore</p>
                <p>I'm not your slave; I want to return to my former self, be myself, and not work myself to the bone
                    for anyone.</p>
                <br />
                <p>As they pounded away on their black keyboards, "They continuously verbally attack me."</p>
                <p>I'm tired of it, it's all just a way of venting out their stress in life</p>
                <p>How much did you get paid to say that you didn't like my work?</p>
                <p>When I look back, I've written so many songs without realizing it, and most of them are just venting.
                </p>
                <p>They don't like me, I don't fucking like you, leave me alone</p>
                <p>Looking at their smiles every day, I'm so sick of it all</p>
                <p>Looking at their kids smiling happily, I don't want to take it anymore</p>
                <br />
                <p>Why did they ruin my childhood when I was a child and their children were so happy?</p>
                <p>All I can think of is unfair treatment. I curse them all to death.</p>
                <p>When it's my turn to bully you next, we'll just have a fair life.</p>
                <p>There's violence and bullying, it's just that the immoral teachers pretend they don't see it.</p>
                <p>They're too weak to stop it.</p>
                <p>They're devils, and I laugh at them all to hell.</p>
                <p>My voice may be a whisper, then I'll kill them all with a rocket!</p>
                <br />
                <p>How can I let go of all that hate? I've already cursed in my mind countless times</p>
                <p>I've thought of how to torture those trash and make them lose their smiles forever.</p>
                <p>You say I'm crazy, I'm fucking crazy. You've driven me crazy.</p>
                <p>They have a lot of sexual fetishes, it's so disgusting, I still kicked them out</p>
                <p>Go away, don't come near me, I'm not a person, I'm that demon in your mind</p>
                <p>There's no kindness in my lyrics, it's all venting, keep venting, venting!</p>
                <br />
                <p>I curse those who look down on me, I reek of ruthlessness</p>
                <p>I hate danger, come near me and you're dead, shove lemons in your stinking mouths</p>
                <p>Sin, forgive me for not getting to know you, you're all I have, my love</p>
                <p>Hate, I'm on my knees begging you to kill them all, don't leave any of the trash alive</p>
                <p>This is my moment of atonement, stay away, stay away, I'll finish you off</p>
                <p>Too much music in my head, I'm still thinking about fixing you guys</p>
                <p>Enough of this, I'm sick of this</p>
                <p>As a demon lord, this is not the end of the story.</p>
