                <p>Place life on the altar, throw hope off the cliff</p>
                <p>What's lost is called sacrifice, what's lost is called the past</p>
                <p>Why is it like this?</p>
                <p>The aching heart aches once more, no one ever cared</p>
                <p>Tried tasting the tears, they are as bitter as the pain</p>
                <p>Darkness is long gone, yet all I see is a white fog</p>
                <p>Don't know how to move forward, how to retreat</p>
                <p>So why is it like this?</p>
                <p>Just wish everything could come to a halt, let go of hatred</p>
                <p>I know it's hard, but the funny thing is, it's our only way</p>
                <p>Leave, leave, and be reborn</p>
                <br>
                <p>Become one</p>
                <p>Two wounded hearts become one again</p>
                <p>Stay away from the restless crowd, just to maintain</p>
                <p>Become one</p>
                <p>Two blackened hearts become one again</p>
                <p>Transform into an unimaginable light, piercing the darkness</p>
                <p>Become one become one again</p>
                <br>
                <p>Bury humility deep within the heart, stand up again to face reality</p>
                <p>Abandon all light, embrace all darkness</p>
                <p>Tell yourself you've changed, you are no longer who you were</p>
                <p>How much suffering is there in a lifetime? All I know is it's never enough</p>
                <p>I won't ask why anymore, I won't ask why anymore</p>
                <br>
                <p>Become one</p>
                <p>Two wounded hearts become one again</p>
                <p>Stay away from the restless crowd, just to maintain</p>
                <p>Become one</p>
                <p>Two blackened hearts become one again</p>
                <p>Transform into an unimaginable light, piercing the darkness</p>
                <p>Become one become one again</p>
                <br>
                <p>Become one</p>
                <p>Two different versions of myself become one again</p>
                <p>Become one</p>
                <p>A child's and an adult's silhouettes become one</p>
                <p>Ultimately learn to let go</p>
