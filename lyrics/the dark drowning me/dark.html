            <div id="lyrics-content">
                <p>Fighting against all odds</p>
                <p>Slowly fading dignity and grace</p>
                <p>Embracing all fears and sympathy</p>
                <p>Why do you always tear me apart?</p>
                <p>You want to see my deepest depths</p>
                <p>But I can't let it drift away</p>
                <p>That's why I keep digging</p>
                <p>And just call my name</p>
                <p>Reaper</p>
                <br />
                <p>The dark drowning me</p>
                <p>I seem unable to think too much</p>
                <p>Prevent everything so this is my heartbeat</p>
                <p>You pressed my lips and told me to take me away</p>
                <p>You know we just waste the day away</p>
                <p>Feeling used is just your own thought</p>
                <p>Because we're always passing by</p>
                <p>Let this all be an avalanche</p>
                <br />
                <p>All alone thinking about it</p>
                <p>We always suddenly notice</p>
                <p>Those sands are messing up my head</p>
                <p>Don't need a sweater</p>
                <p>We just need to keep it on the low</p>
                <p>Waiting for the bells to ring, so please keep your caution</p>
                <p>Take back the land that belongs to us</p>
                <br />
                <p>Addicted to blood, obsessed with fear</p>
                <p>People are always thinking how to peel my skin</p>
                <p>Countless lenses reflecting light</p>
                <p>Get me off</p>
                <p>Feels like a rollercoaster</p>
                <p>Writing on pennies recording everything</p>
                <p>When I hit a wall, I always like to deal with it alone</p>
                <p>Miracles will happen</p>
                <br />
                <p>They didn't even reach out their hands</p>
                <p>Feels like the bottom of the pit</p>
                <p>I feel like we can rain-check this last bit of hypocrisy</p>
                <p>Because Heaven doesn't exist</p>
                <p>In my world there are only rags</p>
                <p>To them I'm just a commodity</p>
                <p>But there's a voice in my head</p>
                <p>Always telling me to Carry On</p>
                <br />
                <p>The dark drowning me</p>
                <p>Feeling immense gravity on my body</p>
                <p>Only lullabies can make me feel at ease</p>
                <p>Breaking through the atmosphere to escape this damn place</p>
                <p>But shackles on my legs are holding me back</p>
                <p>Am I going to bless them for a successful escape?</p>
                <br />
                <p>The dark drowning me</p>
                <p>I just want to curse them</p>
                <p>Who said death is better off</p>
                <p>Everything will only get worse</p>
                <p>Become a phoenix</p>
                <p>They will only appear weaker in my eyes</p>
                <p>This is my determined</p>
                <p>Also a distant future</p>
                <br />
                <p>In this cosmic</p>
                <p>My world is only dust and ugly monsters</p>
                <p>My heart has gone numb</p>
                <p>Rainbows are always black</p>
                <p>That god only refuses</p>
                <p>Life doesn't offer much opportunity</p>
                <p>Pick up available weapons</p>
                <p>No need for any discussion</p>
                <p>There are many traps in front of me</p>
                <p>Self-assured</p>
                <p>Don't always be overborne by them</p>
                <p>Learn to be selfish</p>
