                <p>I am a monster, I am a freak</p>
                <p>I prefer solitude, not crowds</p>
                <p>Quietness is not my nature</p>
                <p>I simply enjoy a life undisturbed</p>
                <br />
                <p>They don't understand, they don't comprehend</p>
                <p>Always looking at me with strange eyes</p>
                <p>I am a monster, I am a freak</p>
                <p>They dislike me because I am unique</p>
                <br />
                <p>I was born this way and never thought to change</p>
                <p>I am myself, I am a monster</p>
                <br />
                <p>I am a monster, I am a monster</p>
                <p>I am a freak, a mental freak</p>
                <p>I don't need their love</p>
                <br />
                <p>I am used to all the loneliness</p>
                <p>All of this they gave to me</p>
                <p>I am used to it, they gave it to me</p>
                <p>This is who I am, they gave it to me</p>
                <br />
                <p>Hatred has become familiar, love is worthless</p>
                <p>I don't need those fake emotions</p>
                <br />
                <p>I am a monster, I am a freak</p>
                <p>No one can understand because I am a monster, I am a freak</p>
                <br />
                <p>In the dark room, there's only me</p>
                <p>Yet I feel so peaceful</p>
                <p>Hehehehaha</p>
                <br />
                <p>I am a monster, a monster</p>
                <p>I am a freak, a freak</p>
                <p>I don't like their likes</p>
                <br />
                <p>I don't need their understanding</p>
                <p>I am a monster, I am a freak</p>
                <p>I don't need their understanding</p>
                <br />
                <p>I just like being alone</p>
                <p>I don't need their pity</p>
                <p>I have long been accustomed to being alone</p>
                <br />
                <p>Please stay away, don't come near me</p>
                <p>If you don't like me</p>
                <br />
                <p>That's just how the world is</p>
                <p>I am used to it, used to it</p>
                <br />
                <p>I don't need anyone's closeness</p>
                <p>I am this way because of you</p>
                <p>You created me this way</p>
                <br />
                <p>I am used to it, used to everything</p>
                <p>I have fallen in love, fallen in love with everything</p>
                <p>I have gone crazy, I am dead</p>
                <p>I am no longer who I was</p>
                <br />
                <p>I am a monster, I am a freak</p>
                <p>Written down word by word</p>
                <p>I am a monster, I am a freak</p>
                <br />
                <p>So you understand I'm not normal</p>
                <p>I am a monster, I am a monster</p>
                <p>A monster without emotions</p>
                <br />
                <p>Falling down, unable to climb back up</p>
                <p>No one's help</p>
                <p>Hehehe, I am used to it</p>
                <br />
                <p>Darkness codes my heart</p>
                <p>My heart is dead</p>
                <p>No forgiveness from anyone</p>
                <br />
                <p>I don't need any of it</p>
                <p>I am used to being alone</p>
                <p>Because I am a monster, I am a freak</p>
                <br />
                <p>Every word, every sentence hurts</p>
                <p>I am used to it, I have accepted it</p>
                <p>Accepted that I am a repulsive monster</p>
                <br />
                <p>I am a monster, I am a monster</p>
                <p>I don't need to resist being called that by others</p>
                <p>I don't need it, I don't need it</p>
                <br />
                <p>I don't need it, I don't need it</p>
