                <p>Good morning, my name is Hoo, and I'm delighted to be here for the interview today.</p>
                <p>I come from Bumbung Lima, and I have strong coding skills and great confidence in my abilities.</p>
                <p>I was particularly drawn to your company because it excels in web design.</p>
                <p>I'm eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to help your company,</p>
                <p>and I believe my coding abilities are well-suited for this position.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I enjoy learning and writing English lyrics, as I find it helps improve my English.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently studying React Native.</p>
                <p>Thank you for considering my application,</p>
                <p>and I look forward to the opportunity to meet with you again.</p>
                <br />

                <p>Hehe, haha!</p>
                <p>When did I also start becoming hypocritical, learning to ink tattoos on my own body,</p>
                <p>Leaving countless scars on my back, all just to sell myself for a job.</p>
                <p>How pitiful of a child, devoid of any self-esteem, not even caring about face anymore.</p>
                <p>Every day, I have to fake a smile in front of those people; surviving their harm is already a
                    victory.</p>
                <p>I just want a quiet life, but without money in life, you can't do anything.</p>
                <p>Life is precious and easily lost. What is money? To say I don't care, that's a lie.</p>
                <p>We all know the darkness of society, we also know the darkness of people.</p>
                <p>Let's see just how deep the darkness of this world truly is.</p>
                <br />

                <p>When I took the poison, devoid of tenderness, devoid of sorrow,</p>
                <p>What a blissful moment it was, in front of the law, we still had to pretend to be naive.</p>
                <p>Don't attempt to challenge them, they might just shoot you down.</p>
                <p>The future, the present, all remain unaltered,</p>
                <p>They all look identical, and their hearts are the same.</p>
                <p>That's a rose, as if it were drenched in my blood.</p>
                <p>When we start working, we lose our childhood and smiles.</p>
                <p>They don't have faith in you, you can only keep your head down, and stay silent continuously.</p>
                <br />

                <p>Stay silent, stay angry, stay true to yourself.</p>
                <p>Please don't talk to me about saving the Earth, protecting animals, and such.</p>
                <p>I can't even protect myself, so what use are you to me?</p>
                <p>You might as well all drink euthanasia, so I don't have to see you.</p>
                <p>My computer is starting to overheat; I must shut it down.</p>
                <p>They smuggled into the U.S., bought a gun, all to shoot the people they despise.</p>
                <p>I've grown accustomed to days like this; as long as you're satisfied, don't mind my thoughts.</p>
                <p>In the end, I can't change anything; that's just the way it is.</p>
                <br />

                <p>Hello, I'm Hoo, and I want to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to participate in this
                    interview.</p>
                <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, and I have previous experience working at my
                    father's factory.
                </p>
                <p>My role there involved boosting product visibility and increasing sales.</p>
                <p>I have a strong interest in your company's design, particularly in how it enhances the lives of
                    customers.</p>
                <p>I believe that my marketing skills and spirit of teamwork can contribute to the company's success.
                </p>
                <p>I have a passion for continuous learning and personal growth. I thrive on facing challenges and
                    seeking innovative
                    solutions to problems.</p>
                <br />

                <p>I'm quite nervous about this interview because I'm about to start my internship, and time is limited.
                </p>
                <p>We need to learn English quickly and reduce our gaming time, right?</p>
                <p>Hehe, haha!</p>
                <br />

                <p>Oh, they bribed him, gave him a lot of money.</p>
                <p>They're not gangsters; they're all police officers.</p>
                <p>They carry many sins, even prayer won't help.</p>
                <p>You can't stop it, everything will still happen.</p>
                <p>Beginners, please drive slowly. My beloved cousin was killed by a beginner driver.</p>
                <p>Their IQs are high, but their actions are foolish.</p>
                <p>Close your eyes and pray non-stop; even God won't forgive you.</p>
                <p>Unjust accusations, they only exploit others to make money.</p>
                <p>The world is very indifferent, the world is very indifferent.</p>
