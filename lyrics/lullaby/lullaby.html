            <div id="lyrics-content">
                <p>Under the moonlight, we cry, no one's comfort, only you by my side,</p>
                <p>You are the one I've conjured, I don't know where the meaning of life resides.</p>
                <p>They always like wars, but I prefer peace,</p>
                <p>Hope lost in my eyes, watching them chat endlessly, watching them chat endlessly...</p>
                <p>I hope for the emergence of light.</p>
                <p>Too many mistakes in my life, can't escape them, time slipping away,</p>
                <p>I keep playing the piano, howling this song, hoping tomorrow will be different, hoping tomorrow will
                    be different.
                </p>
                <p>Hu~ Don't want to wake up, don't want to wake up.</p>
                <br />
                <p>After downing one beer and then another, I look at the clock; it's already 1 AM,</p>
                <p>I don't want to go home because there's no one waiting for me there.</p>
                <p>The black night makes me weary; I don't want to do anything, just want to disappear.</p>
                <p>Work is always a source of scolding; learning to run away isn't shameful,</p>
                <p>But where is the meaning of life?</p>
                <p>They always say we should learn to be happy, but how do we learn?</p>
                <p>The pale expression reveals a sense of helplessness towards this world; they don't want to bother
                    anymore.</p>
                <p>No goals, no loved ones, what else do they have left?</p>
                <br />
                <p>In a bookstore, on deserted streets,In a pitch-black room,</p>
                <p>Emotions gone awry, songs no one hears,Dirty hands,</p>
                <p>Playing the violin, everything,Perhaps, just an illusion.</p>
                <p>After graduation, the helplessness,The future of life, slowly fading away.</p>
                <p>In the time of a poem, his clothes are all wet,</p>
                <p>Another person's company, yet he remains lonely.</p>
                <p>But so what? It doesn't matter anymore.It doesn't matter anymore.</p>
                <br />
                <p>When it comes to emotions, he always lacks confidence,From the past to the present, his heart remains
                    lonely.</p>
                <p>He doesn't want to speak too much nonsense,He just wants to be alone in quiet.</p>
                <p>A song can help him stay calm,It's merely a form self-comfort.</p>
                <p>Some pain can't be put into lyrics,Every day, he wants to lie in bed and do nothing.</p>
                <p>The sunlight, like poison, constantly invades his world,</p>
                <p>Is this world destined to always be like this?</p>
                <p>Many sins on his shoulders remain unrelieved,He continues to keep silent.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Breathing can be painful,Fear slowly approaches us, saying "I've had enough of all this" in different
                    ways.</p>
                <p>Let me continue to be alone in peace, don't wake me up.</p>
                <p>There are too many things happening, I can't solve them all.</p>
                <p>The candle melts quickly, just like time passing swiftly.</p>
                <p>They didn't give us time to prepare for the happiness we wanted.</p>
                <p>The lessons they've taught me, I'll always remember, That's my reward,</p>
                <p>That's my prize.</p>
