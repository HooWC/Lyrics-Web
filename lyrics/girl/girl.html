            <div id="lyrics-content">
                <p>"I fell in love with that girl, her lips are so delicious</p>
                <p>Every move she makes intoxicates me, making me unable to forget her</p>
                <p>I want to be held by the big sister, living in fantasies forever without waking up</p>
                <p>Please, don't let me wake up; this world has too many perverts</p>
                <p>I don't want to meet them; imperfect people are just too ugly</p>
                <p>They don't care about your feelings at all, why do you keep serving them?</p>
                <p>You've changed; you're not the girl I used to know</p>
                <p>You're willing to sell your body for money."</p>
                <br />
                <p>"Many people are changing, but I don't want to change; I want to remain as I am now.</p>
                <p>The only thing missing is your love; without you, I can't live.</p>
                <p>They thank me for taking such good care of you, but I hate them.</p>
                <p>Everyone's eyes are full of seduction, desire, but in my eyes, there's only money.</p>
                <p>I don't want to become like them.</p>
                <p>I want to take you away, leave this dirty place.</p>
                <p>I want to live with you; you are my only, my love.</p>
                <p>But you pushed me away, and I don't understand why."</p>
                <br />
                <p>"Holding a gun to your head, not letting you run too far, so I can't catch up.</p>
                <p>They've all started to bully you, but you don't fight back, just keep letting them laugh at you.</p>
                <p>My music can represent this scene, a sad story.</p>
                <p>Plus songs no one loves, how fitting for this atmosphere.</p>
                <p>They always stay the same, or remain unchanged.</p>
                <p>When I spent a lot of money to buy you a limited edition bag, you'll follow me.</p>
                <p>Limited edition bags, why are they so expensive?"</p>
                <br />
                <p>"I change my clothes every three days, I don't like watching horror movies because you're not by my
                    side.</p>
                <p>The time on my computer is always inaccurate, and the screen on my phone has started to crack.</p>
                <p>I can't do anything well without you; missing you is something I can't control.</p>
                <p>I can't afford to lose you; you know it, I know you know what I want.</p>
                <p>Why did you still leave me? I could jump off a cliff for you right away.</p>
                <p>Why is deep love always so sorrowful? They say I have no talent.</p>
                <p>I want to love you, I want to hold you, not let you leave, and make you happy for a lifetime."</p>
                <br />
                <p>"People are starting to praise me, but I don't care; all I care about is you.</p>
                <p>God starts to do drugs, taking away all the opportunities, and no one can forgive Him.</p>
                <p>The table was too dirty; I wiped it with a cloth, making it cleaner.</p>
                <p>I'm still single, not dating; I don't want to be made fun of.</p>
                <p>Honesty always gets hurt; they love to die so much, why do you want to stop them?</p>
                <p>I don't want to hear official apologies; don't tell me anything about formal legal letters; don't
                    make me laugh.</p>
                <p>Give my girl back to me quickly, or I'll eliminate you all."</p>
                <br />
                <p>"The police said to me: 'Drop your weapon, raise your hands.'</p>
                <p>People told me: 'You will never succeed; you will only fail.'</p>
                <p>My girl, I just want to tell you: I won't give up on you.</p>
                <p>Wait for me; I will rescue you when I come back, away from this haunted place."</p>
