                <p>Ya, Oh</p>
                <p>Ya, Oh</p>
                <p>They're used to how to sing, sing a nice melody</p>
                <p>Walking down the street with a diamond ring on her hand showing off that she's rich.</p>
                <p>There's money all over the place. It's a no-go zone. No one's allowed in there.</p>
                <p>The young people under the sky keep singing for peace in the world.</p>
                <p>This song is full of love and we hope others will hear and understand it.</p>
                <p>Let them sway their bodies to our melody and dance together</p>
                <p>"Admitting her promises were very fragile, I swear I won't do it again."</p>
                <p>Those were all lies I'll never believe again</p>
                <br />
                <p>Live the way you want to live, don't care what other people think.</p>
                <p>The future is ours, they can't control us. Laugh if you want to, young man.</p>
                <p>Follow the music in your heart and live your life. Be brave, young man.</p>
                <p>Dance in the deserted streets without any shame.</p>
                <p>The world is a beautiful place, though they always force us to cry out</p>
                <p>But the heart's true, there's nothing wrong with hiring me</p>
                <br />
                <p>Keep singing in the rain, I'm a grown man with my own style</p>
                <p>Too invested in projects that get me a lot of money, they'll never make it in the marketplace</p>
                <p>They want to invest but they don't have the dice and want to steal everything from us</p>
                <p>God is very friendly, don't be afraid, the sweetness will never come out</p>
                <p>Adults always tell us to learn to be patient, but I'm the kid who fights back</p>
                <p>This dirt is so dirty, please give me five orders of fried rice with fresh meat</p>
                <br />
                <p>So what? So what, yo?</p>
                <p>You're always cheating on me. I can't take it anymore. I'm not the same idiot I was.</p>
                <p>I've learned how to grow up. The person I was is dead.</p>
                <p>And I don't want to run anymore. The world is mine. I'll control you people.</p>
                <p>No one can order me around. His eyes were so bright. Oh</p>
                <p>I remember. - So what? So what?</p>
                <p>Get the fuck out of here.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Accountants are too smart, bosses are too savvy</p>
                <p>Everybody's not stupid and they've learned how to take their weapons and fight</p>
                <p>Mad at myself, my soul is long dead, this association is a sham</p>
                <p>No one can chew on me, I'm my whole self, they're just jealous of me</p>
                <p>Bitches with no money tell them to fuck off, this society's too proud</p>
                <p>Learn to fight back, I'm not a poor man, tear your mouths apart</p>
                <p>I'm a genius. I live like a genius every day.</p>
                <br />
                <p>They're starting to hate me. I don't care, kid.</p>
                <p>"They exist like garbage, their presence is too low."</p>
                <p>Stay low, stay alive, walk out in a fire, see what I do with them</p>
                <p>Too much room, but I'm the only one, I'm used to it all</p>
                <p>Wrote the code like a piano, I'm strong, no one can beat me</p>
                <p>Keep jumping up and down to the beat, be yourself</p>
